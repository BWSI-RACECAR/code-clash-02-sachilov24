Code Clash #2 - Digit Decrypt (digitdecrypt.py)


Author: Koneshka Bandyopadhyay

Difficulty Level: 4/10

Prompt: Koneshka has a collection of 9 RACECARS, each with unique speed and a crypted 
identification number that helps identify the rankings of each of the RACECARS in terms
of speed. Write a program that helps identify the ranking of a car given the identification
number. The way we can decrypt this identification number is by adding digits of the number 
until we reach single digits. For example: Let’s say that the identification number is 38. 
Then, we add ‘3’ + ‘8’ to get 11. We further add the digits ‘1’+ ‘1’ to get 2, ranking the car
in 2nd place or 2nd fastest out of 9. Car with identification 1111 gives us 1+1+1+1=4, ranking 
the car 4th fastest out of 9. The goal is to add the digits until we reach single digits.

Test Cases:
Input: 48 Output: 3

Input: 13 Output: 4

Input: 0 Output: 0
